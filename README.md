#### About App

The app utilizes Github API to search for users and their repositories.

- You can load more repositories up to 30 repositories shown on page. (If user have more than 30 repos, load more button will dissapear and a link to user's github repositories page will appear.)
- If you type a username that does not exist, an error notification will pop up.
- If you exceed the search limit (60 search per hour), a different error notification will pop up.
